# DataGlowUp-26

This is challenge that asks for you to structure Olist data.

## Structure

To handle the Olist data, i've maked an API that allows you to add data to each table at Olist database, based on the csv's. Morevover, the data will pass throught Pydantic to check if that data is right, if it's not, it will give an error message to you correct the data.

After the API and Database are setted, The Soda will check the data Quality of each database table, following the rules that i've setted.

The data quality will complement the unit tests that i've setted.

Finaly the structure is finaly done.
